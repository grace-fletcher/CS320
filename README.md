**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
One way that I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure is by testing the code, program, or software. There are many different testing techniques to choose from, but there are two distinct methods that we focused on in this course: static testing and JUnit testing. Static testing occurs when the developer simply scans through the code and looks the code over to see if, visually, any errors stick out. JUnit tests are implemented in the code, and the testing happens when the code is executed.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
The interpretation of user needs typically happens when the proposed system is analyzed. Common examples include interviewing the product owner or interviewing potential users/customers of the system. As a developer/tester in this course, once I had feedback from users of the system, I then used their needs to determine what needed to be added to or changed within the program.

**How do I approach designing software?**
The first step in designing software would be to understand what the user/product owner wants, as mentioned above. Once this is understood, and the user needs and requirements can be implemented, the design process can happen a lot more naturally and efficiently.
